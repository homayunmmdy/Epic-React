## Clean up state with useState

Cleanup in useEffect is a function that runs to clean up resources (like subscriptions or timers) when a component unmounts or before re-running the effect. You do it by returning a cleanup function from the useEffect callback.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function Example() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      console.log("Running...");
    }, 1000);

    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer);
      console.log("Cleaned up!");
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>Check the console!</div>;
}

export default Example;
```

## lifting state 
Lifting state up is a technique used in React to share state between multiple components. Instead of each component having its own local state, the state is lifted up to their closest common ancestor. This common ancestor then passes the state down to the components through props.

## colcate state
it's oppsite of lifting state in the react
basically we Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible.

for example instead of give state into parent we pass the related on into childrens in general colocate the state as much as possible
