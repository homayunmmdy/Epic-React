# React Lifecycle

The React lifecycle begins with the **initial render**, where the component is first rendered to the DOM. During this phase, React creates the **DOM elements** based on the component's structure and state.

When a **user interacts** with the application (e.g., clicking a button or typing in an input), the component's state may change. This triggers a **re-render**. Unlike a full page refresh, React efficiently updates only the parts of the UI that have changed. It achieves this by comparing the **old virtual DOM** with the **new virtual DOM** in a process called **reconciliation**. React then applies only the **necessary changes** to the real DOM, ensuring optimal performance.

After the update, React waits for the next **user interaction**, and the cycle repeats.

# Query in React

In React, a "query" often refers to a search term or filter condition used to fetch or display specific data. When using `useState`, you can store this query as a state variable, allowing you to dynamically update and filter data based on user input. For example, if you have a list of items, you can use a query state to filter the list as the user types.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

  const filteredItems = items.filter((item) => item.includes(query));

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      <ul>
        {filteredItems.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `query` is the state variable that holds the filter condition, and `filteredItems` dynamically updates based on the query.
