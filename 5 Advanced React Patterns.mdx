# Composition
Composition in React involves building components by combining smaller, reusable components. The Composition Layout Pattern organizes these components into structured layouts, often using props like children to nest components flexibly within a parent container.

## Props drilling
Props drilling occurs when data is passed down through multiple layers of components via props, even if intermediate components don't use the data. This can make the code harder to maintain and less efficient. Solutions like Context API or state management libraries (e.g., Redux) are often used to avoid it.
