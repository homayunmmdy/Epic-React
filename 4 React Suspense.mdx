# use Hook
**`use` hook**, introduced in React 18. It is used to unwrap promises, typically for handling async data fetching inside components. It simplifies working with Suspense by automatically suspending the component until the promise resolves.  

```tsx
import { use } from "react";

async function fetchData() {
  return "Hello from async!";
}

export default function MyComponent() {
  const data = use(fetchData()); // Suspends until the data is ready
  return <p>{data}</p>;
}
```
Here, `use(fetchData())` automatically suspends rendering until the promise resolves, making it easier to handle async data without useEffect or state.
