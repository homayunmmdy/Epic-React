# Difference between SPA and RSC

### **SPA (Client-Side Rendering):**
1. **Browser:** Requests the initial HTML file (usually a minimal shell) and JavaScript bundle from the server.
2. **Server:** Sends the HTML and JS bundle to the browser.
3. **Browser:** Downloads and executes the JavaScript, which then fetches data (e.g., from APIs) and renders the page content dynamically on the client side.

### **RSC (React Server Components):**
1. **Browser:** Requests the page from the server.
2. **Server:** Renders the React components on the server, fetches data, and sends the fully rendered HTML (with minimal JavaScript) to the browser.
3. **Browser:** Displays the pre-rendered HTML immediately, then hydrates any interactive parts with JavaScript if needed.

### **Key Difference:**
- **SPA:** Rendering happens in the browser after loading JavaScript.
- **RSC:** Rendering happens on the server, sending ready-to-display HTML to the browser.
