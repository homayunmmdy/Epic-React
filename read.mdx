  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.23.5/babel.js"></script>

  <script type="text/babel">
    function message({ children }) {
      console.log('Calling message', children)
      return <div className="message">{children}</div>;
    }

    const element = (
      <div className="container">
        {React.createElement(message, { children: 'Hello World' })}
				{React.createElement(message, { children: 'Goodbye World' })}
			</div>
    );
